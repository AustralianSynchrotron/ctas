Changes in the end-user interface.

Since version 0.2
	  ct - Removed short version of option --alha-sigma: -s.
	  dei - Option -E changed to -d.
	  dei - Option -C changed to -c.
	  dei - Option -D changed to -f.
	  dei - Option --data changed to --fd.
	  rc2fd - Option -E changed to the first argument <RC file>.
	  rc2fd - Option -C changed to the optional second argument <FD file>.
	  ct - Option -f, --filter changed interface, but compability with the old version remains: now it accepts the filter also by name.
	  ct, tomo, ctr - Options "-a", "--absorption", "-r", "--refraction" removed. Use "-C", "--contrast" <contrast> option instead: "-C a", "-C absorption", "-C r", "-C refraction".

Since version 0.3
	  cta - Executable renamed to "ct-abs".
	  ctr - Executable renamed to "ct-dei".

Since version 0.4
	  all - Now -v|--verbose option, when combined with the -h|--help and -?|--usage options produces more detailed output (sometimes too much detailed - use man pages instead).
	  ct, ct-dei, ct-abs, ts - removed option --alsig. Instead the option -f|--filter now has input format "STRING[:FLOAT]", where the optional second part does what --alsig option did.
	  ct-abs, ct-dei - Now the option -c|--center has the second part (aconf coefficient) optional. It is equal to 0 by default.
	  rc2fd, dei, sino-dei, ct-dei - Removed -A|--alpha, -N|--number, -I|--intensity, -R|--reflectivity options and replaced them with -I|--meaning=<MEAN> option where <MEAN> is one of "A", "ALPHA", "N", "NUMBER", "I", "INTENSITY", "R", "REFLECTIVITY".
	  dei, sino-dei, ct-dei - removed -d|--dei, -f|--fd options: from now on only the rocking curve input is used (not the EDEI pre-processed one - forget about it if you don't need this). Instead of using -d|--dei option the DEI processing is forced if the --rc option is abscent in the CLI input. Also I removed the short version of the option --rc (-c): now it has only the long version.
