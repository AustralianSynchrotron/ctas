Build and install as the standard cmake project. Usually like this:

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr/local ..
	make
and as root:
	make install

A very outdated documentation is placed under the doc subdirectory. More up to date information on usage is provided with the --help option in all tools which can be combined with the --verbose for more information. Start with
	ctas -h
and continue with something like
	ctas <tool> -h
