Before version 0.3 (DONE)

One single binary which includes all steps of the data processing.
Now the package contains a set of tools each capable of doing one single job: background removal, DEI extraction, reconstruction, etc. However, each of these tools saves the intermediate data into some files on disk, what is far from being effective from many points of view: the disk space, memory consumption, file I/O operations (especially regarding very flexible, but inefficient approach of the ImM library). The single binary which combines all the steps can process data with only one input and one output disk operation. This will dramatically increase the computation time. The presence of this single binary will not remove any of the currently present tools since they can still be useful for the data processing.


Before version 0.4

(DONE) Prepare separate "sinogram" and "slice" tools: the "sinogram" will read foreground-background pairs from the FgBg file similar to the "cta" and "ctr" tools.The "slice" tool will replace current "sinogram" tool. I.e. it will read any number of files and form the sinogram without any processing (flat field subtraction, etc).

(NOT) Add possibility to read vertical slices (currently assume the rotation axis is vertical, i.e. perpendicular to the image's horizontal axis).

(DONE) Clear up the CT algorithm:
- make the output data mathematically correct
- include discrete correction into the filtering function
- logarithm for the absorption contrast 


Before version 0.5

Full multithreading and multi-CPU approach. Now only a very basic threading is realized in the CT reconstruction algorithm. However, regarding soon the super-computer which will soon arrive to the Australian Synchrotron, the multi-CPU approach is unavoidable.
